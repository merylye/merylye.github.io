I’ve been a little stressed about school. 
I keep assuming that most of my overwhelm is coming from school and my lack of progress. 
But I’ve realized that this year has had a lot of changes. 
I’m not just navigating grad school. I’m navigating how to be an adult. I previously lived in a dorm for college, where I had access to a dining hall. And all I had to clean was a small room with a bed and desk. And do laundry. 
Now, I have to regularly cook and clean for myself, buy groceries, and do laundry. So not only am I navigating grad school. I’m navigating becoming an adult. I know my peers are doing this as well, but I think it’s still impressive for me.
