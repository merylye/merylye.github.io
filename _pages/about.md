I'm a first-year Societal Computing PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science's [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) (yes, it is quite a mouthful). My advisor is [Patrick Park](https://patpark.org/).

I broadly study user behavior and information movement in online social networks. Topics that interest me include user wellbeing, conflict, and misinformation. 

Previously, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in Computer Science (2023). I am grateful to have worked with [Malte Jung](https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) in my undergraduate research, which primarily focused on the fields of human-robot interaction and social computing.
