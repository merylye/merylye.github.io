I'm a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science's [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/). My advisor is [Patrick Park](https://patpark.org/).

I broadly study user behavior and information movement in online social networks. Topics that interest me include user wellbeing, conflict, and self-presentation. 

I graduated from Cornell University in 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am grateful to have worked with [Malte Jung](https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) in my undergraduate research, which was primarily in human-robot interaction and computational social science.
