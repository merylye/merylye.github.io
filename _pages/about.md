Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science's [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Steve Rathje](https://stevenrathje.com/) and [Bob Kraut](https://kraut.hciresearch.info/).

I study how people present themselves and share information in digital social environments. My research examines how platform design and affordances shape audience management, self-disclosure, and parasocial interaction. Recently, I’ve extended this work to human–AI interaction, exploring why people choose to self-disclose to LLMs and how sycophantic AI behaviors affect users’ attitudes, confidence, and trust. More broadly, my work sits at the intersection of computational social science (CSS), human–computer interaction (HCI), and social media.

I graduated from Cornell University in 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am grateful to have worked with [Malte Jung](https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) in my undergraduate research.

_I'm always happy to connect with new people. Whether you're curious about my work, thinking about grad school, or just want to talk ideas, feel free to send me an email!_
