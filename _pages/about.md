I'm a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science's [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/). My advisor is [Patrick Park](https://patpark.org/).

I broadly study user behavior and information movement in online social networks. Topics that interest me include user wellbeing, conflict, and misinformation. 

Previously, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in Computer Science (2023). I am grateful to have worked with [Malte Jung](https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) in my undergraduate research, which primarily focused on the fields of human-robot interaction and social computing.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
